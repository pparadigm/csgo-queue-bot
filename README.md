*A Discord bot to manage and setup CS:GO games*

This script uses the Discord Python API via a bot to manage queues of CS:GO players who want to play with other Discord server members. It is complete with a queueing system, team drafter, map drafter and a link to a unique PopFlash lobby.

Testing item here
## Setup
1. First you must have a bot instance to run this script on. Follow Discord's tutorial [here](https://discord.onl/2019/03/21/how-to-set-up-a-bot-application/) on how to set one up. Be sure to invite it to a server to use it.

   * The permissions integer necessary is `17067072`.

2. (Optional) If you have a Discord Bot List token to use with [top.gg](https://top.gg/) then retrieve that from its editing menu.

3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the repository's root directory to get the necessary libraries.

    * Note that python-Levenshtein requires your system to have a C++ compiler (Visual Studio C++ compiler for Windows or g++ for Linux). This library may be replaced in the future to eliminate this requirement.

4. Add the `/qbot` path to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to be able to import it from anywhere.

5. Using your bot's Discord token and Discord Bot List token, run the bot like so...

```python
import qbot

DISCORD_TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXX'
qbot.run(discord_token=DISCORD_TOKEN)
```

Now you are ready to start using the CS:GO Queue Bot! Try out some of the commands to make sure it works.

*Note that currently the `mdraft` command depends on custom emojis to be used as buttons which are hardcoded [here](https://github.com/cameronshinn/csgo-queue-bot/blob/abb06e1876546bb3948094faa795e90184642882/qbot/cogs/mapdraft.py#L20). As of right now you will need to make the emojis yourself and replace the emoji code in the map objects there.*
